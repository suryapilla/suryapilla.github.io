📚📖📝: I am currently pursuing Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering, specializing in Robotics and Vision

🔬: I am primarily engaged in studying Vision and Robotics, with a specific focus on autonomous vehicles. Consequently, my ongoing research revolves around Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).



Throughout my academic projects, I have engaged in diverse research areas. I have developed a Particle Filter for indoor localization and mapping using LiDAR, implemented Visual Inertial SLAM using an Extended Kalman Filter, and designed algorithms for autonomous navigation, trajectory tracking, and motion planning.

With my strong educational background, technical proficiency in programming languages and frameworks such as Python, C++, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and TinyML, as well as experience in software and computing environments, I am well-prepared to make valuable contributions to the field of robotics and autonomous vehicles.
