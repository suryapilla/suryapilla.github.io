# Robotics and Autonomous Systems Projects

This repository showcases a collection of robotics and autonomous systems projects that I have worked on. Each project demonstrates my expertise in various areas of robotics, including SLAM, autonomous navigation, trajectory tracking, and motion planning.

## [Particle Filter SLAM](https://github.com/suryapilla/Particle-Filter-SLAM)  
Developed a Particle Filter algorithm for indoor localization and mapping of a differential-drive robot.  
Utilized LiDAR data to generate a probabilistic occupancy grid of an unknown environment.

## [Visual Inertial SLAM](https://github.com/suryapilla/VISLAM)
- Implemented Visual Inertial SLAM (VI SLAM) using an Extended Kalman Filter approach.
- Fused sensor measurements from gyroscope, accelerometer, and camera to track the 3D pose of the robot and create a landmark map.

## [Autonomous Navigation](https://github.com/suryapilla/Autonomous-Navigation)
- Designed and implemented a dynamic programming algorithm for deterministic shortest path planning.
- Optimized control actions to find the shortest path from a starting point to a key location while avoiding obstacles.

## Trajectory Tracking
- Solved a non-linear optimization problem using Python CasADi solver.
- Developed an optimal control policy for accurate trajectory tracking.
- Compared the performance of Receding-Horizon Certainty Equivalent Control and Generalized Policy Iteration techniques.

## Motion Planning
- Compared search-based (A*) and sampling-based (RRT) algorithms in a continuous 3D environment.
- Evaluated their efficiency and effectiveness for generating collision-free paths.

These projects demonstrate my proficiency in robotics algorithms, sensor fusion, path planning, and control optimization. Each project represents my ability to apply theoretical concepts to practical robotics challenges.
