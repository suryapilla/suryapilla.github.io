## 1. Honeywell Technology Solutions | BU: Safety and Productivity Systems

Location: Bangalore, India

Position: Embedded Engineer – II

Duration: July 2019 – July 2022

### Responsibilities
- Implemented a fire detection algorithm into the existing 3IR flame detector, ensuring compliance with critical EN54 (European certification), resulting in a reduction of 10 months in the development cycle and the saving of over 10 human resources for data collection.
- Developed a Machine Learning (ML) framework using Python scientific libraries that was compatible with the existing dataset for Triple IR sensor-based flame detection. This framework saved 150 man-hours of the data collection cycle.
- Trained and deployed a state-of-the-art object detection model (YOLOv4) on NVIDIA Jetson Nano for autonomous maritime search-and-rescue purposes, which successfully secured project funding from the global team.
- Collaborated with a 3-member team to analyze IR flame signature data and design an ML algorithm for deployment on legacy hardware. Achieved 98% flame detection accuracy using Python, MATLAB, and IAR embedded framework.
- Mentored 3 interns in the areas of Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV), providing guidance on technical aspects and fostering professional efficiency.

### Achievements
- Filed 6 Trade Secrets and 2 U.S. patent applications, resulting in 8 IP awards. The applications are currently under review.
- Awarded the Diamond award for securing the 2nd position out of 276 ideas presented at the annual innovation competition, SParkS.
- Awarded the Silver award for developing new Fire Path for flame detector.
- Received the Silver award for developing a new Fire Path for the flame detector.
- Certified as a Six Sigma Green Belt in DFSS Hardware and completed an AI/ML Bootcamp.

### Innovation
- Prototyped a novel visible plus thermal camera-based flame detection system for the annual innovation challenge. This solution utilized Computer Vision (CV), deep learning, and TinyML frameworks, contributing to the creation of high-value Intellectual Property.

## 2. Visteon Technical and Services Centre Pvt Ltd

Location: Chennai, India

Position: Intern

Duration: May 2018 – July 2018

### Responsibilities
- Designed and modeled a Neural Network using Keras to automate the classification of automobile telltales, achieving an accuracy rate of 98%.
- Developed an algorithm utilizing XCode (C++) and OpenCV that was three times faster than traditional methods for computing the degree of rotation of the analog fuel indicator in a car.
