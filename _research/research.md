# UC San Diego

Location: San Diego, CA

## Summer Research Internship
Duration: July 2023 - September 2023

- Created a self-supervised learning pipeline that utilized SuperPoint keypoint descriptor extraction from privacy-preserving lens images. This pipeline was developed for Visual Inertial Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) purposes.

- Designed a Neural Network pipeline to extract feature descriptors from an Event Camera for performing SLAM.

## Graduate Student Researcher
Duration: January 2023 - June 2023

- Developed a slippage correction algorithm specifically for eyeglass-mounted cameras. This algorithm enabled accurate calibration of gaze estimation, resulting in a reduction of real-world gaze mapping errors from 40% to 20%.
