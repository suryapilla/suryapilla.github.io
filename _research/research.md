## UC San Diego

Location: San Diego, CA

### Existential Robotics Laboratory
Duration: September 2023 - Present

- Designing a pipeline to employ optimal scene graph planning using a large language model(LLM) to generate linear temporal logic and use anytime multi-resolution multi-heuristic A* algorithm for planning

- Developed indoor localization and mapping for ERL robot powered by Nvidia Jetson mounted with Hokuyo 2D lidar using ROS, utilized Gazebo simulation and RViz for visualization of indoor navigation

### Summer Research Internship
Duration: July 2023 - September 2023

- Integrated learnable lens parameters into the loss function of end-to-end computational imaging system model using pytorch to enable the deep optics model to prevent human face identity from cyber attack

- Designed a DBSCAN clustering pipeline for processing event data captured by a dynamic vision sensor to differentiate fire signature from rest of the dynamic moving object

### Graduate Student Researcher
Duration: January 2023 - June 2023

- Developed a slippage correction algorithm specifically for eyeglass-mounted cameras. This algorithm enabled accurate calibration of gaze estimation, resulting in a reduction of real-world gaze mapping errors from 40% to 20%.
